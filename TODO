Notes/Ideas/TODO, in no particular order:

[ ] non-daemon mode behaves differently (no chdir, ...)
[ ] see TODO note regarding state changes in data_types.h
[ ] --threshold-low for scripts, this allows to handle events like "battery full"
[ ] --single-shot: exit after any/all scripts have been run once
[?] pass TimeToEmpty/TimeToFull to scripts
[x] pass percentage, remaining running time,... as env vars
[ ] detect suspend/resume etc. (--inhibit,-I)
     -- dbus, polkit/consolekit/logind?
     -> http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/devkit-devel/2013-January/001339.html
     -> http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/xfce4-power-manager.git/tree/xfce4-power-manager-1.2.0-systemd-suspend-hibernate.patch

   Maybe just detect system resume.

[ ] optionally reset script status to "not run" when a timer expires,
    for notification scripts etc. (-> periodic scripts)
[ ] [nice-to-have] built-in actions, @action
[_] fallback battery code is purely theoretical so far...
[ ] battery add/remove handling is TODO, see upower-listener.c
[ ] logging...
[ ] [options marked as TODO in README.rst]
[ ] make daemon code optional (#ifdef ENABLE_DAEMON)
[ ] improved IPC (socket,...?)
[?] init script generic, openrc
[x] bashcomp
[ ] maybe (optionally) add polkit support so that pm-suspend etc. can be run
     directly without running the daemon as root
     // or use euid,egid or CAP_SETUID,CAP_SETGID
     // recommending sudo for now
[ ] some sort of config/rule file(s)
